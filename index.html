    <h2>Beef Cuts</h2>
    
    <p>
        Good beef should be deep dark red from being dry-aged (hung),
        and well marbled with fat, although excess fat should have been trimmed off already.
        If a beef breed is specified, this is a good indicator of quality.
        Bright red beef that has not been aged will have less flavor.

    <h2>Before it is Meat</h2>
    
    <p>
        Before it is meat, it is muscle. In the living animal, muscles convert chemical energy into mechanical
        activities such as running, swimming or flying. In the kitchen, these activities have come to an end, but their
        influence lives on in surprising ways. <br> The chef's primary goal when cooking meat is to maximize
        juiciness, flavor and tenderness. But what is juiciness, and what are the factors that determine it? What
        exactly is meant by flavor, and where does it come from? Many common misconceptions based on an
        incomplete understanding of the unique biochemical nature of meat can lead cooks astray-or at least
        prevent them from making the most of a cut.<br> Maximizing tenderness may seem a more obvious goal than
        agreeing upon the best strategy for enhancing flavor, but it is no less prone to misunderstanding and
        mythological explanations.
