    <p>Most cuts from this part of the carcass are used for processing as it is fatty with connective tissue. But there
        are several thin muscles that can be grilled or fried if served pink.</p>
    <p><b>SHORT RIBS OR BOILING BEEF</b> These chunky pieces of rib have a thick layer of meat and fat. They make good
        soup but increasingly are also cooked long and slow in a rich reduction sauce. </p>
    <p><b>HANGER STEAK OR ONGLET</b>A dark muscle from the diaphram, hanger does little work in the animal so is fairly
        tender. Other flank muscles are skirt and flank, both thin and fibrous. All can be cooked pink.</p>
    <p><b>TRI-TIP</b> A small triangular muscle from the end of the sirloin that makes good roasts and steaks or cubes
        for grilling. Another section of tri-tip forms part of the thick flank.</p>
    <p><b>GROUND</b> Fatty ground flank is used for sausages while grinding the shank and hind leg results in leaner
        product.</p>
